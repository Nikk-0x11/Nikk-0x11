<h3># About Me:</h3>

Hey there! I'm **Nikhil** ðŸ‘‹. But I am mostly known as **Nikk** on internet. <br> I'm a **first year CS student** who lives in **India**. I'm learning **how to code**. <br> I love web development.  It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. <br> I also enjoy programming in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **Go-Lang** because they challenge me more.

I regularly keep working on different projects related to web and software to gain real world development experience.
